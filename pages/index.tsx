          Early on in my career I decided I wanted to be an expert in
          JavaScript. So I set my mind on mastering the world's most popular
          programming language. I spent countless hours writing JavaScript for
          the companies I worked for as well as in the evenings for open source
          and other side projects. Eventually I even represented PayPal on the
          TC-39 (the committee responsible for standardizing the JavaScript
          language). I feel like I achieved my goal of becoming an expert in
          JavaScript, but I do need to keep up just like everyone else, which is
          an enjoyable challenge.

          I've also always been excited about sharing what I know with others.
          When I was in school, I signed up to be a tutor for my classmates and
          once I even got Firebase to sponsor pizza for me to give an informal
          workshop about Angular.js to my fellow students. I was a speaker at
          the first meetup I ever attended, and I've now delivered over a
          hundred talks on topics including JavaScript, React, Testing, Careers,
          and more. One of my talks got noticed by egghead and I was invited to
          turn that talk into an egghead course. The rest is history!

        <p className="opacity-80">
          One of the biggest things that has helped me learn is by committing
          myself to sharing what I know with others. Between podcasts, blog
          posts, talks, and workshops, I force myself into situations where I
          have to be accountable to those I'm teaching to really know my stuff.
          And as a result, a lot of people have learned from me as well.
