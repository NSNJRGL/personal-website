          First of all, let me share my story of how I fell in love with the
          computer the very first time. When I was in ninth grade, my parents
          bought me a computer and internet. At the time, It feels like magic
          when I first entered to google.com website. After that, I have been
          trying to find how things are working, like this way. Like a child, I
          became curious about everything. This characteristic is not changed at
          all. Even though I got into a job, I have been trying to find another
          solution to implement any problem. My coworkers used to say to me, how
          did you find out these kinds of interesting things. I think one of the
          valuable things that I give to my team or organization is curiosity. I
          think this attitude has been relevant to me since I was a child.

          Early on in my career I decided I wanted to be an expert in
          JavaScript. So I set my mind on mastering the world's most popular
          programming language. I spent countless hours writing JavaScript for
          the companies I worked for as well as in the evenings for other side
          projects. I feel like I achieved my goal of becoming an expert in
          JavaScript, but I do need to keep up just like everyone else, which is
          an enjoyable challenge.
